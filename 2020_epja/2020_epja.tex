\begin{abstract}
  The differential cross sections of the charge exchange reaction \dpchex has
  been measured at 1.75 \GeVc per nucleon for small transferred momenta using
  the one arm magnetic spectrometer STRELA at the Nuclotron accelerator in JINR
  Dubna. The ratio of the differential cross section of the charge exchange
  reaction \dpchex to that of the \np elementary process is discussed in order
  to estimate the spin-dependent part of the \np charge exchange amplitude. The
  \np amplitude turned out to be predominantly spin-dependent.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
In the theory of nucleon-nucleon scattering extracting complex amplitudes of the
scattering matrix is a matter of fundamental importance. For all amplitudes to
be obtained, a complete experiment must be performed, \textit{i.e.}, an
experiment with a set of observed quantities providing a full and exhaustive
description of this process. Such an experiment comprises measurements with
polarized both projectile and target what is large and laborious task.

However, under certain experimental conditions, there is a possibility to
determine some amplitudes of the scattering matrix or a set of them. One of the
chances is the charge exchange reaction on the deuteron \dpchex with the use of
unpolarized protons and unpolarized deuterons, which under certain conditions is
determined only by the spin-dependent amplitude of the elementary \np
scattering. When studying the differential cross section of this reaction at
small four-momentum transfer squared, it is possible to estimate the
spin-dependent term of the \np scattering amplitude in the context of the
impulse approximation. The effect can be understood qualitatively in the
following way. Two nucleons, bound in the deuteron may be in $^3S_1$ and $^3D_1$
$(T = 0)$ spatial and spin symmetric states; their isospin is antisymmetric. In
the \dpchex charge exchange on the proton target the transition from $^3S_1$ or
$^3D_1$ to a charge symmetric $^1S_0$ or $^1D_2$ state of the two protons
requires spin flip, in order to satisfy the Pauli principle and ensure an
antisymmetric total wave function. The two secondary protons are produced at
angle close to $0^\circ$ w.r.t. the incoming deuteron. In this way, the
spin-dependent part of the elementary charge exchange amplitude will be
reflected through the probability of the charge exchange process on the
deuteron.

The original idea to take use of the charge exchange reaction on the unpolarized
deuteron to determine the spin-dependent part of the \np charge exchange was
proposed by Pomeranchuk \cite{pom51} and Chew \cite{chew51}. Later this
possibility was emphasized in a series of works
\cite{mig55,pom51_2,lap57,dea72,dea72_2,ala75,ala75_2,bug87}. The mathematical
description was developed later by Dean \cite{dea72,dea72_2}. These formulas
were obtained under certain assumptions, namely relying on the validity of the
impulse and closure approximations. In the work by Lednicky and Lyuboshitz
\cite{led04} it was shown that at relativistic energies these two assumptions
are also justified.

In the general case the nucleon-nucleon ($NN$) amplitude in the centre of mass
system can be presented as \cite{gla02}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mat_full}
  \begin{split}
    M =\ a\ +\ &b
    (\boldsymbol{\sigma}_1\,\mathbf{n})
    (\boldsymbol{\sigma}_2\,\mathbf{n})\ +\ c\bigl[
    (\boldsymbol{\sigma}_1\,\mathbf{n}) +
    (\boldsymbol{\sigma}_2\,\mathbf{n})\bigr]\ \ + \\
    +\ &e
    (\boldsymbol{\sigma}_1\,\mathbf{m})
    (\boldsymbol{\sigma}_2\,\mathbf{m})\ +\ f
    (\boldsymbol{\sigma}_1\,\mathbf{l})
    (\boldsymbol{\sigma}_2\,\mathbf{l})\,,
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
where the orthonormal basis
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{l} =
  \frac{\mathbf{k} + \mathbf{k}'}{|\mathbf{k} + \mathbf{k}'|}\,, \quad
  \mathbf{m} =
  \frac{\mathbf{k} - \mathbf{k}'}{|\mathbf{k} - \mathbf{k}'|}\,, \quad
  \mathbf{n} =
  \frac{\mathbf{k} \times \mathbf{k}'}{|\mathbf{k} \times \mathbf{k}'|}\,,
\end{equation}
introduced in \cite{gol66} is used. The unit vectors $\mathbf{k}$ and
$\mathbf{k}'$ are in the direction of the incoming and scattered particles,
respectively. $\boldsymbol{\sigma}_1$ and $\boldsymbol{\sigma}_2$ are the Pauli
$2\times2$ matrices for the beam and target nucleons.

The differential cross section of the elementary \np charge exchange can be
represented as a sum of the spin-independent (superscript $SI$) and
spin-dependent (superscript $SD$) parts
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:np_sum}
  (d\sigma/dt)_{\np} = (d\sigma/dt)^{SI}_{\np} + (d\sigma/dt)^{SD}_{\np}\,.
\end{equation}
The mathematical formalism developed in \cite{dea72, dea72_2, bug87} allows to
connect the differential cross sections of the deuteron charge exchange and the
elementary \np reactions. In the impulse approximation the $dp$ charge exchange
differential cross section at small momentum transfer $|t|$ is related to the
$NN$-amplitudes via
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dp_13np}
  \begin{split}
    (d\sigma/dt)_{\dpchex} =\ &\bigl[1 - F_d(t)\bigr]\,(d\sigma/dt)^{SI}_{\np}
    \quad + \\
    &\bigl[1 - 1/3\,F_d(t)\bigr]\,(d\sigma/dt)^{SD}_{\np}\,,
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
where $F_d(t)$ denotes the deuteron form factor, $t = (P_d - P_1 - P_2)^2$ is
the four-momentum transfer squared from the incoming deuteron to the two fast
protons. $P_1$, $P_2$ are the final fast protons four-momenta and $P_d$ is the
incoming deuteron four-momentum.

\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    (d\sigma/dt)^{SI}_{\np} &= |a|^2 +|c|^2\,,\\
    (d\sigma/dt)^{SD}_{\np} &= |b|^2 + |c|^2 + |e|^2 + |f|^2\,,
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
and the coefficients $a, b, c, e$ and $f$ refer to spin invariants of the
elementary charge exchange amplitude in Eq. \eqref{eq:mat_full}
\cite{dea72,ala75_2}.

In this paper we consider the case, when the scattering angle is very small,
close to zero. Under such kinematical conditions one obtains $b = e$ and $c = 0$
and for the elementary cross sections simple expressions can be written
\begin{equation}
  (d\sigma/dt)^{SI}_{\np} = |a|^2\,,
  (d\sigma/dt)^{SD}_{\np} = 2\,|b|^2 + |f|^2\,,
\end{equation}
where the amplitude $a$ is spin-independent, and $b$ and $f$ are spin-dependent.
Equation \eqref{eq:dp_13np} implies that at zero transfer $|t| = 0$,
\textit{i.e.} at the neutron CMS scattering angle $180^\circ$, when
$F_d(0) = 1$, the differential cross section reduces to
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dp_23np}
  (d\sigma/dt)_{\dpchex} = 2/3\,(d\sigma/dt)^{SD}_{\np}\,.
\end{equation}

So, the charge exchange breakup reaction of the unpolarized deuteron on the
unpolarized proton target at zero transfer ($t = 0$) is completely determined by
the spin-dependent part of the elementary \np backward scattering in CMS, so the
deuteron acts as a spin filter. It should be noted that this result also remains
valid when the deuteron $D$-state is taken into account \cite{led04}. Thus,
studying the \dpchex process at small transferred momenta allows to estimate the
spin-dependent part of the elementary \np reaction.

The first experiment of such type has been realized at the JINR
Synchrophasotron, irradiating the one meter hydrogen bubble chamber (1m HBC)
with deuteron beams of 3.35 \GeVc momenta. The differential cross section
$d\sigma/dt$ of the \dpchex reaction was measured and the extra\-polated value
of $(d\sigma/dt)|\,_{t=0}=(30.2\,\pm\,4.1$) mb$/$(\GeVc)$^{\,2}$ obtained.
Comparison with the elementary \np charge exchange data led to a conclusion,
although with great statistical uncertainties, about the prevailing contribution
of the spin-dependent part into the \np amplitude \cite{gla02,gla08}.

Before our investigations, no experiments with fast deu\-teron beams have been
carried out in the energy range above 1~\GeV. Experiments with monochromatic
fast deuterons are more rational in respect to the analysis of experimental
data: the two secondary protons, products of the charge exchange on deuteron
\dpchex, are fast moving in the forward direction at small angles, and so they
are easily detectable.

These studies made it possible to propose the layout of a counter experiment for
studying the charge exchange reaction with sufficient statistical accuracy in
unpolarized deuteron beams at energies above 1~\GeV. Several variants of the
detector layout and magnet for the proposed experiment STRELA were suggested and
realized. For the observation of the proton pairs in a narrow cone coming from
the \dpchex reaction several variants of experimental setup, named STRELA, were
suggested and realized. For the optimization of the experiment geometry the
above $dp$ events from 1m HBC were used as input the GEANT3 simulations
\cite{gla13}.

In the meantime the interest to obtain information on the cross section of the
spin-dependent part of the \np scattering renewed. In the region above 1 \GeV
results on the reaction $nd \rightarrow p(nn)$ in a neutron beam of the JINR
VBLHEP Delta-Sigma group at seven values of beam kinetic energies from 0.5 to
2.0 \GeV appeared \cite{sha09,sha09_2,shi11}. Experiment ANKE at COSY Juelich
storage ring carried out an extensive study of the \dpchex charge exchange
reaction in vector and tensor polarized deuteron beams at four energies from 0.6
to 1.135 \GeV per nucleon \cite{chi09,mch13}.

The aim of the present study is to determine the differential cross section of
charge exchange reaction \dpchex at $t = 0$ in unpolarized deuteron beam by the
STRELA spectrometer, extract information on the elementary \np charge exchange
amplitude and compare with the existing experimental results.

\section{Experimental facility STRELA}

\begin{figure*}[t] % two-column wide

  \includegraphics[width=1.00\textwidth]{STRELA_layout.pdf}
  \caption{Schematic layout of the experimental setup to study the \dpchex
    charge exchange channel, consisting of scintillator counters (S1~--~S3),
    drift chambers (DC1 -- DC4), analyzing magnet M and target T.}
  \label{fig:STRELA_layout}
\end{figure*}

Based on the above mentioned ideas and experimental results, obtained using the
1m HBC \cite{gla02,gla08}, the experiment STRELA has been designed and
constructed in the Veksler Baldin Laboratory for High Energy Physics (VBLHEP) of
the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna with the aim to select
and detect charge exchange events in deuteron proton collisions. The experiment
demands registration of two protons with momenta approximately equal to the half
of the primary deuteron beam momenta. STRELA is a typical one arm magnetic
spectrometer consists of scintillator detectors (S1 -- S3) used to trigger the
setup and blocks of drift chambers (DC1 -- DC4) used as coordinate detector,
analyzing magnet M and targets (C and CH$_2$), see Fig. \ref{fig:STRELA_layout}.

The sensitive areas of the drift chambers are the following: 12.5 $\times$ 12.5
cm$^2$ for DC1, DC2 (small chambers) and 25 $\times$ 25 cm$^2$ for DC3, DC4
(large chambers). The right handed coordinate system has been used, where the
$z$ axis is in the beam direction and $x$ and $y$ axis lie in the plane of the
chambers. All chambers contain an (Ar\,+\,CH$_4$) gas mixture and have
alternating, orthogonal $x$ and $y$ coordinate planes. Chambers DC1, DC3, DC4
are equipped with $xy$ wires and DC2 only with $x$ wires. DC1 and DC3 are
composed of 8 sensitive planes ($4y$, $4x$), DC4 is composed of 4 sensitive
planes ($2y$, $2x$) while the DC2 contains 4 sensitive planes ($4x$).

The drift length for all chambers is $r_{max} = 21$ mm. The basic
characteristics of the drift chambers have been established from irradiation of
a polyethylene target with a deuteron beam of 3.5 \GeVc momentum. For each wire
the minimal $t_{min}$ and maximal $t_{max}$ drift times have been
determined. The average total drift time was found to be $\sim$~450~ns. In the
track finding procedure the relation between the measured drift time and the
minimal distance from the anode wire to the track plays an important role. To
find the function, transforming the drift time $t$ to radius $r$, also referred
to as $r(t)$ relation, is the central task. This transformation function may
depend on many parameters like: the electric field strength, the gas mixture,
the pressure, the temperature and the drift chamber geometry. For determination
of the transformation function two methods are applied: the linear or quick one,
mainly used for the preliminary results and online monitoring, the second
method, called cumulative or integral one suitable for offline purposes, which
gives the final results. The spatial resolution of the drift chambers used in
the STRELA setup is in the range of $\sim$~80\,--120~$\muup$m
% \muup (or \upmu) not for mathptmx
(Fig.~\ref{fig:res_chambers}). The minimal time between consecutive signals is
$\sim$~50 ns, which corresponds to a minimum distance of $\sim$~2 mm between the
tracks in the drift chamber, which fully satisfies the requirement of the STRELA
experiment. Moreover, the analyzing magnet enhances the space separation of the
recorded protons from the examined reaction. More technical details and the
algorithm of the track reconstruction can be found in \cite{gla13}.

\begin{figure}[t]

    plane of drift chambers: (a) small and (b) large. The solid curve is a
    double Gaussian approximation.}
  \label{fig:res_chambers}
\end{figure}

The experimental setup was started by coincidence of two scintillation counters
S1 (dimensions 7.5 $\times$ 7.5 $\times$ 0.5 cm$^3$) and S2 (dimensions diameter
3.0 $\times$ 0.2 cm$^3$). The signals from the XP 2020 photomultipliers are
connected to the shapers with constant fraction timing in order to compensate
the time jitter of the amplitude signal. The time and amplitude information from
the counters is digitized and recorded in each event for the subsequent
monitoring of the counters and the entire trigger system functionality.

The dipole electromagnet 2SP-40, with transverse dimensions 100 $\times$ 30
cm$^2$ and length 150 cm, creates the required magnetic field 0.85 T and used as
an analyzing magnet. The recorded protons of about the half of the incident
deuteron beam momentum from the examined reaction are bended at 0.289 mrad to
the blocks of large drift chambers (DC3 and DC4) for detection; unscattered
primary deuteron beam does not enter the sensitive areas of these chambers. The
momentum resolution measured with the primary deuteron beam of 3.5 \GeVc is
about 1~\%.

Carbon (C) and polyethylene (CH$_2$) targets are used to extract the $dp$
interaction by subtracting CH$_2$ and C distributions. The size of the targets
is determined by carbon nuclei equivalent. Its shape are cylindrical, both with
diameters of 60 mm. The length of targets CH$_2$ and C are 48 mm and 54 mm,
respectively. The density of H nuclei per cm$^2$ for CH$_2$ target is (4.74
$\pm$ 0.05)$\times$10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$.

The measurement was done at the intensities of beam of 2~--~3~$\times$~10$^5$
deuterons per second, duration of the spill was 4~seconds. The deuteron flux
(number of triggers) has been determined using S1 and S2 scintillation counters
in coincidence. This is corrected for the efficiency of the drift chambers and
admixture of protons in the primary deuteron beam using the empty target
measurements. The value of the correction is different from run to run and is in
the interval 0.85~--~0.89.

The trigger system selects events of the deuteron breakup reaction, where at
least one charged track inclined by magnet reaches the drift chambers DC3 and
DC4. The momenta of the tracks in the event are reconstructed using information
form the magnet and from the drift chambers. Into the analysis only the events
containing two reconstructed tracks are involved.

The detector performance for two-track events was estimated by the use of the
GEANT3 package for transporting the $dp$ interaction products from the 1m HBC
events through the STRELA experimental setup. The plots of momenta
$p_1$~\textit{vs.}~$p_2$ of the two charged particles reaching the DC3 and DC4
chambers are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:p1vsp2_sim}. Simulation including all $dp$
interaction channels (a) and \dpfrag channel only (b). From this comparison and
the fact that 1m HBC is full solid angle detector one can judge that the two
protons of the charge exchange reaction are fully in the detector acceptance.

\end{figure}

\section{Data analysis and experimental results}
The experimental facility has been irradiated in the beam of deuterons with 3.5
\GeVc momenta and approximately milliard triggers were taken. The first step in
the analysis was to decode events. Calibration procedure and the track
reconstruction in the drift chambers transformed the raw data into physical
quantities. For the further processing and physical analysis three tracks in the
$xz$ plane drift chambers were selected: one before the target and two behind
it. The topology of this events is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:STRELA_layout}. The
momentum of the particles (protons) was determined from the angle of deflection
of the charged particle after passing through the magnet M.

The \dpfrag events reaching the drift chambers DC3 and DC4 are supposed to
contain: two protons from the charge exchange reaction \dpchex with momenta
approximately equal to the half of the beam momenta, or a single proton from the
charge retention \dpret channel, where the recoil proton is filtered out by the
magnet.

In the presented data (Fig. \ref{fig:p1vsp2_exp}) two well-seperated areas can
be distinguished as well as in the simulated ones
(Fig.~\ref{fig:p1vsp2_sim}~(a)). The more populated ellipse like area in
Fig. \ref{fig:p1vsp2_sim}~(a) can be ascribed to the charge exchange events if
one compares with the results of simulation in
Fig. \ref{fig:p1vsp2_sim}~(b). This crosschecks the statements made about the
detector acceptance above. The arch like areas in Fig. \ref{fig:p1vsp2_sim}~(a)
and Fig. \ref{fig:p1vsp2_exp} correspond to background two-track events. A
simple cut on the sum of the two reconstructed momenta can remove the events
from the arch like area.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.43\textwidth]{p1_vs_p2_2.pdf}

The obtained distribution of the sum of the two charged particles (two protons)
momenta for both CH$_2$ and C targets are displayed in Fig. \ref{fig:p1p2exp},
distinguished by long dashed and dashed lines, respectively. The difference of
the two distributions (full line) shows that the background from C target can be
neglected. The results of simulation (Fig. \ref{fig:p1p2sim}) include all
channels of the $dp$ interaction (a) and \dpfrag channel only (b). Note that for
the simulation real events (with relatively small statistics) from the 1m HBC at
the momenta 3.35~\GeVc were used. As one can see, the distribution has a
characteristic peak near the incoming deuteron momentum kinematically associated
with the pair of protons from the \dpfrag reaction (Fig. \ref{fig:p1p2exp}).
Into the further analysis only those events have been included, where the sum of
two charge particles momenta is in the interval (3.5 $\pm$ 0.2) \GeVc.

\end{figure}

The main goal of present experiment is to determine the differential cross
section $(d\sigma/dt)|\,_{t=0}$ of \dpchex, which can be done as an
extrapolation of the measured data to $|t|\mapsto0$. This can be connected
according to Eq. \eqref{eq:dp_23np} with the spin-dependent part of the \np
process.

The measured $dN/dt$ distribution of the \dpchex reaction is displayed in
Fig. \ref{fig:dndt} together with the curve corresponding to a fit by
empirically well established expression
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dndtfit}
  dN/dt = a\,\exp(b\,t)\,,
\end{equation}
with parameters $a=(435.6 \pm 6.8)$ and $b=(-440.9 \pm 9.1)$.
% Chi2/ndf = 77.93/78 (entries=4373, xbins=80)
The value $(dN/dt)|\,_{t=0}$ was transformed to cross section
\begin{equation}
  % \sigma =
  % \frac{1}{n\,lb_w}\ln\bigg(1\Big/\Big(1-\frac{N_{int}}{N_0}\Big)\bigg)\,,
  % \bigg(\frac{d\sigma}{dt}\bigg)\Big|_{t=0} =
  \frac{d\sigma}{dt}\Big|_{\,t=0} =
  \frac{a}{n\,l\,b_w}\ln\bigg(\frac{N_0}{N_0-N_{int}}\bigg)\,,
\end{equation}
where $n$ is the number of H nuclei in cm$^{-3}$ in target, $l$ is the target
length in cm, $b_w$ is the histogram bin width. The number of interactions
$N_{int}$ and the number of incoming deuterons $N_0$ were corrected for the
efficiency of chambers.

  \caption{Differential distribution $dN/dt$ of the \dpchex reaction. The solid
    line is approximation by Eq. \eqref{eq:dndtfit}.}
  \label{fig:dndt}
\end{figure}

The value $(dN/dt)|\,_{t=0}=(435.6\,\pm\,6.8)$ N$/$(\GeVc)$^{\,2}$ corresponds
to the charge exchange reaction differential cross section
$(d\sigma/dt)|\,_{t=0}=(30.56\,\pm\,0.48$) mb$/$(\GeVc)$^{\,2}$.

The quoted \,error is statistical \,only. \,Systematic uncertainties which
affect the overall normalization of the cross sections have been estimated to be
about 5~\%. This uncertainty stems mainly from the deuteron flux determination.
The uncertainty from the target thickness and the histogram bin width are
comparably small.

The obtained charge exchange differential cross section on the deuteron at $t=0$
was compared with the available data from \np reaction at the same interpolated
energy from published data. The closest energy data comes from measurements made
at the SATURN accelerator \cite{biz75,bys78}. Unlike to the other similar
experiments, Bizard et al. \cite{biz75} used quasi monochromatic neutrons from
accelerated deuteron stripping with a momentum spread of 5~\%. New data about
\np scattering at the momenta of incident quasi monochromatic neutrons at 1.43,
2.23 and 5.20 \GeVc have been obtained in \cite{tro14}.

The values of $(d\sigma/dt)|\,_{t=0}$ of \np reaction as a function of the
incident momenta is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:npsigma}. Each individual
differential cross sections from Bizard et al. \cite{biz75} are transformed into
$d\sigma/dt$ versus $t$ in the region of momenta 1.4~--~2.0 \GeVc and
extrapolated at each momentum to $t=0$ by fitting the expression
$d\sigma/dt = a\,\exp(b\,t + c\,t^2)$.

To determine the $(d\sigma/dt)|\,_{t=0}$ of the \np reaction at ``our incident''
proton momentum of 1.75 \GeVc per nucleon, an exponential fit is made to the
results of Fig. \ref{fig:npsigma}, which gives the following value of
$(d\sigma/dt)|\,_{t=0} = (48.0\,\pm\,0.2$) mb$/$(\GeVc)$^{\,2}$. The
systematical error due to fit procedure is approximately 5~\%. The obtained
value will be related to the estimated differential cross section of the quasi
elastic \dpchex charge exchange at $t=0$ from our experiment.

One can introduce the ratio of the differential cross sections for the forward
scattering (charge exchange) on the deuteron and proton
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    R_{\np} &= \frac{(d\sigma/dt)_{\dpchex}}{(d\sigma/dt)_{\np}} \\
    &= 0.64 \pm 0.01\,\mathrm{(stat.)} \pm 0.04\,\mathrm{(syst.)}.
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
Under the assumption Eq. \eqref{eq:dp_23np} and Eq. \eqref{eq:np_sum} stated
above this, $R_{\np}$ can be related to
\begin{equation}
  R_{\np} = \frac{2}{3}\,\frac{(d\sigma/dt)^{SD}_{\np}}{(d\sigma/dt)_{\np}}
\end{equation}
and accordingly the value of the spin-independent part of the elastic \np charge
exchange cross section has been obtained as
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    R^{\,ID}_{\np} &= \frac{(d\sigma/dt)^{SI}_{\np}}{(d\sigma/dt)^{SD}_{\np}}
    = \frac{2}{3\,R_{\np}} \ - \ 1 \\
    &= 0.05 \pm 0.02\,\mathrm{(stat.)} \pm 0.07\,\mathrm{(syst.)}.
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
It should be emphasized that the obtained contribution, of course, depends on
the elementary \np charge exchange cross section which is taken from another
experiment and on the systematical errors of approximately 5~\% which is due to
the fit procedure. Preliminary data published in \cite{bas14,bas16} are not
contradicting the presented results.

\section{Conclusion and outlook}
The spectrometric complex has been developed on the basis of the STRELA setup to
study the charge exchange reaction in unpolarized deuteron beam. The value of
the charge exchange reaction \dpchex differential cross section
$(d\sigma/dt)|\,_{t=0}=(30.56\,\pm\,0.48$) mb$/$(\GeVc)$^{\,2}$ has been
obtained at 1.75 A \GeVc per nucleon. This value agrees with the differential
cross section $(d\sigma/dt)|\,_{t=0}=(30.2\,\pm\,4.1$) mb$/$(\GeVc)$^{\,2}$
obtained by means of a one meter hydrogen bubble chamber at 1.675 A \GeVc per
nucleon. The obtained ratio of the charge exchange differential cross sections
at $t=0$ for \dpchex and \np reactions
$R_{\np} = 0.64 \pm 0.01\,\mathrm{(stat.)} \pm 0.04\,\mathrm{(syst.)}$ testifies
the prevailing contribution of the spin-dependent part to the \np scattering.
This ratio depends on the $(d\sigma/dt)|\,_{t=0}$ of the \np reaction extracted
from published data.

In the region above 1 \GeV Delta-Sigma group published the
$R_{dp}(0) = (d\sigma/dt)_{\,nd} / (d\sigma/dt)_{\,np}$ ratios
\cite{sha09,sha09_2,shi11} at seven values of the neutron energies
$T_n = 0.5 - 2.0$ \GeV. Both $nd \rightarrow p(nn)$ and \np reactions were
detected in the same experiment. The reported contributions of the non-flip to
flip ratio in the \np charge exchange are estimated between 0.551 and 0.589
depending on energy. The value of $R_{dp}(0) = 0.553 \pm 0.026$ at 1.0 \GeV
\cite{sha09} is within the experimental uncertainties consistent with our
result. The experiment with monochromatic fast deuterons is more rational in
respect to the analysis of experimental data, \textit{e.g.} STRELA. The two
secondary protons, products of the charge exchange on deuteron \dpchex are fast
moving in the forward direction at small angles, and so they are easily
detectable.

In the works \cite{chi09,mch13} the \dpfrag reaction as was used to study
neutron proton charge exchange amplitudes on the ANKE spectrometer at the COSY
storage ring at deuteron energies of 0.6, 0.8, 0.9 and 1.135 \GeV per nucleon.
A rich set of data has been obtained on the differential cross section, vector
and tensor analyzing powers as well as on the spin correlations of the charge
exchange reaction. The whole set of data allowed to draw a conclusion on the
individual amplitudes of the \dpchex scattering. On the other hand, the
spin-independent amplitude $\alpha$, whose magnitude can only be estimated by
comparing the deuteron data with the free \np differential cross section, is
absent.

So, to extend the studies to higher energies on STRELA setup is acceptable and
the preparation is in progress.

The experimental setup begins with the two polystyrene based scintillators S1
(dimensions 10 $\times$ 10 $\times$ 0.5 cm$^3$), S2 (dimensions 7 $\times$ 7
$\times$ 0.5 cm$^3$) and ends with S3 scintillator (dimensions 25 $\times$ 22
$\times$ 1.0 cm$^3$). The light guides are made of plexiglass. For light readout
XP 2020 photomultipliers were used. The signals from the photomultipliers are
connected to the shaper inputs. The use of these shapers allows to compensate
the time spread of the signals caused by the leading edge of the amplitude of
the photomultiplier signal. The time and amplitude information from the counters
is digitized and recorded in each event for the subsequent monitoring of the
counters and the entire trigger system functionality.

The analyzing dipole electromagnet 2SP-40, with transverse dimensions 100
$\times$ 30 cm$^2$, was used as an analyzing magnet. The magnet creates the
required magnetic field in the range of \,0.7~--~1.0 T at a distance of 150 cm
along the path of the particles. The separation of the non interacting deuteron
beam and that of the recorded protons from the examined reaction are bended to
the blocks of large drift chambers for detection. The radius of the curvature of
the stripping protons trajectory in the magnet is about 7 m at the value of the
magnetic field 0.83 T.

Carbon (C) and polyethylene (CH$_2$) targets have been used to extract the $dp$
interaction. Carbon target was used to account for the background events. The
final distributions of the $dp$ interactions are obtained by subtracting CH$_2$
and C distributions with coefficient one. The size of the targets have been
determined by carbon nuclei equivalent. The shape of targets CH$_2$ and C are
cylindrical, both with diameters of 60 mm. The length of targets CH$_2$ and C
are 48 mm and 54 mm, respectively. The density of H nuclei per cm$^2$ for CH$_2$
target is (4.74 $\pm$ 0.05)$\times$10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$.


The setup was irradiated in deuteron beams of an incident momentum of 3.5 \GeVc
with intensity not lower then $\sim 10^{7}$ particles per spill. Since the drift
chambers are operable at intensities lower than $\sim 10^{6}$ particles per
spill, a steel collimator with a rectangular aperture of 4 $\times$ 4 mm$^2$ and
a length of 1.2 m has to be used to reduce the intensity. After applying the
collimator the deuteron beam intensity of $\sim 5\times10^5$ particles per spill
or below is reached at the target.

This is corrected for the efficiency of the drift chambers and

measuring the differential cross section
of the \dpchex reaction. The extrapolation to $t=0$ gave the value of
$(d\sigma/dt)|\,_{t=0}=(30.2\,\pm\,4.1$) mb$/$(\GeVc)$^{\,2}$, the quoted error
is only statistical. The obtained ratio of charge exchange differential cross
section at $t=0$ for \dpchex to that of the \np reaction is
$R_{\np} = 0.55 \pm 0.08$. The ratio of the elementary spin-independent to
spin-dependent elastic \np charge exchange cross sections
$R^{\,ID}_{\,\np} = 0.21 \pm 0.17$ has been obtained \cite{gla08}. This result
testifies the prevailing contribution of the spin-dependent part to the the \np
amplitude \cite{gla02,gla08}.

% original
The study of the charge exchange reaction using the chamber based technique made
it possible to propose a layout of an electronic experiment for studying the
charge exchange reaction for obtaining a statistically justified result the
elementary $np$ scattering amplitude using a unpolarized deuteron beam in the
energy range above 1 \GeV. For the observation of the proton pairs in a narrow
cone coming from the \dpchex reaction several variants of experimental setup,
named STRELA, have been suggested and realized. The specific geometry of the
experiment was selected based on real events and Monte Carlo calculations with
the aid of the GEANT3 software package. Using real events of $dp$ interactions
in a hydrogen bubble chamber as input a variant of layout the spectrometer for
measurement differential cross section at $t=0$ was simulated \cite{gla13}.

The aim of the present study is to extract information on the elementary \np
charge exchange channel using the \dpchex charge exchange reaction at 3.5 \GeVc
deuteron momenta by the STRELA spectrometer \cite{gla13}. The existing data on
that reaction at the energies above 1 \GeV are still very scanty. During the
past few years, interest in obtaining information on the cross section of the
spin-dependent part of the \np scattering renewed. This is partly connected with
achievements of the polarization research method at Dubna JINR VBLHEP
(Nuclotron) and Juelich (COSY). It is important to stress that Nuclotron
accelerator to provide beams of multi charged ions with energies of up to 6 \GeV
per nucleon, protons and unpolarized or polarized deuterons. The maximum energy
of COSY accelerator is 1.15 \GeV per nucleon. The chance of restoring the

\noindent (Delta-Sigma info)\\
In the region above 1 \GeV the results of study reaction $nd \rightarrow p(nn)$
in a neutron beam of the Delta-Sigma group \cite{sha09,sha09_2,shi11} are known,
where the $R_{dp}(0) = (d\sigma/dt)_{\,nd} / (d\sigma/dt)_{\,np}$ ratios have
been successfully measured. Seven data points at the energies $T_n = 0.5 - 2.0$
\GeV have been obtained using liquid D$_2$ / H$_2$ and solid CD$_2$ / CH$_2$ / C
targets. The contribution of non flip to flip ratio in the \np charge exchange
process have been estimated via $R_{dp}(0)$ values which are from the interval
0.551~--~0.589 depending on energy. The experiment with monochromatic fast
deuterons is more rational in respect to the analysis of experimental data: the
two secondary protons, products of the charge exchange on deuteron \dpchex, are
fast moving in the forward direction at small angles, and so they are easily
detectable.

only the differential cross section of the \dpchex charge exchange reaction, but
also vector and tensor analyzing powers as well as the spin correlation
parameters have been measured. The whole set of data allowed to draw a
conclusion on the individual amplitudes of the $pn$ scattering. On the other
hand, the spin-independent amplitude $\alpha$, whose magnitude can only be
