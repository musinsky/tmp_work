Dear Professor Obertelli,
In answer to the referees of Manuscript ID EPJA-105992. The suggestions of the referees were accepted and correspondingly the article was seriously modified.

Referee: 1
All the comments were accepted, however some of them we would like to comment.

"Page 1, line 45, left col.: The statement sound trivial, did the authors mean "possibility to determine ... " from a limited set of observables?"
Yes, we have in mind the limited set of observables as explained in next sentence.

"Page 1, line 56, 57, left col.: what is the "fast particle" and "the struck nucleon in the deuteron" in the context of a general eq. 1 for NN-interaction?"
By fast particle we meant the scattered nucleon and by struck in the deuteron we meant the participant nucleon from the deuteron. In the new version the paragraph was rewritten.

"Page 6, equation 9, How was this formula obtained?"
The formula used for cross section is the classical definition N_int = N_0*(1 - e^-#sigma*n*l). The whole paragraph was rewritten.


Referee: 2
All the comments were accepted and included into the text.


We would like to express our acknowledgment towards the referees. Their remarks and suggestions were indeed useful and will improve the quality and readability of the paper.

Best regards,
